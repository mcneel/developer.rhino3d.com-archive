It is presumed you already have the necessary tools installed and are ready to go.  If you are not there yet, see [Installing Tools (Windows)](/guides/rhinocommon/installing-tools-windows).

## HelloRhinoCommon

We will use the RhinoCommon Templates to create a new, basic, command plugin called HelloRhinoCommon.

If you are familiar with Visual Studio, these step-by-step instructions may be overly detailed for you.  The executive summary: create a new Solution using the RhinoCommon template, build and run, and then make a change.

We are presuming you have never used Visual Studio before, so we'll go through this one step at a time.

### File New

1. If you have not done so already, *launch Visual Studio* (for the purposes of this guide, we are using Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition and C#).
1. Navigate to *File* > *New* > *Project*...
![File New Project](/images/your-first-plugin-windows-01.png)
1. A *New Project* wizard should appear.  In the left column, find the *Installed* > *Visual C#* > *Rhinoceros* section.  In the central list, select the RhinoCommon Plug-In template...
![New Project](/images/your-first-plugin-windows-02.png)
1. For the purposes of this Guide, we will name our demo plugin *HelloRhinoCommon*.  At the bottom of the window, fill in the *Name* field.  *Browse* and select a location for this plugin on your disk...
![Project Configuration](/images/your-first-plugin-windows-03.png)
1. Check *Create directory for solution*.  *Note*: This is optional depending on how you want to structure your projects.
1. Click the *OK* button.  *Note*: You don't have to add the project to source control for this demo.
1. The *New RhinoCommon Plug-In* dialog appears.  This dialog allows you to *Configure your new plugin project*, as well as select which RhinoCommon references to use and which debug version of Rhino you would like to launch...
![HelloRhinoCommon Solution](/images/your-first-plugin-windows-04.png)
1. For the purposes of this guide, we will *accept the defaults* and click *Finish*...
1. A *new solution* called *HelloRhinoCommon* should open...

### Boilerplate Build

1. Before we do anything, let's *build* and *run* HelloRhinoCommon to make sure everything is working as expected.  We'll just build the boilerplate Plugin template.  Click *Start* (play) button in toolbar corner of Visual Studio (or press <kbd>F5</kbd>) to *Start Debugging*...
![Start Button](/images/your-first-plugin-windows-06.png)
1. *Rhinoceros* launches.  Create a new, empty model.
1. Since this is the first time you are running the plugin, you need to *"install"* it.  (The RhinoCommon template has set things up so when you compile the solution an *.rhp* file is compiled in the *bin* subdirectory of the project directory.) In the Rhino command prompt type the *PlugInManager* command.  Click the *Install...* button.
1.  *Browse* to the *HelloRhinoCommon.rhp* file (in our case, this is in *C:\\dev\\repositories\\HelloRhinoCommon\\HelloRhinoCommon\\bin\\*) and click *Open*.
1. The HelloRhinoCommon plugin is now installed.  Click *OK* to close the Rhino Options dialog.
1. Enter the *HelloRhinoCommonCommand* command.  Notice that the command autocompletes...
1. The *HelloRhinoCommonCommand* command begins and prompts you to *Please select the start point:*.
1. Notice there is *also a command status* in Rhino's command prompt when the command begins: *The HelloRhinoCommonCommand command will add a line right now.*
1. *Finish* the command by selecting a start point and and end point.
1. Also note there is *a command status* in Rhino's command prompt when the command ends: *The HelloRhinoCommonCommand command added one line to the document.*
1. *Exit* Rhinoceros.  This stops the session.  Go back to *Visual Studio*.  Let's take a look at the...


### Plugin Anatomy

1. Use the *Solution Explorer* to expand the *Solution* (*.sln*) so that it looks like this...
{{< image url="/images/your-first-plugin-windows-07.png" alt="Solution Anatomy" class="float_left" width="400" >}}
1. The *HelloRhinoCommon* project (*.csproj*) has the same name as its parent solution. The project that was created for us by the *RhinoCommon Plugin* template wizard earlier.
1. *Properties* contains the *AssemblyInfo.cs* source file.  This file contains the meta-data (author, version, etc).
1. *References*: Just as with most projects, you will be referencing other libraries.  The *RhinoCommon Plugin* template added the necessary references to create a basic plugin.
1. *Eto* is the cross-platform User Interface toolkit that comes with Rhino.
1. *Microsoft.CSharp* contains classes required for C# code compilation.
1. *Rhino.UI* contains the Windows-specific User Interface classes.
1. *RhinoCommon* is *the* critical reference for our purposes here.
1. *System*, *System.Core*, *System.Drawing*, *System.Windows.Forms* are .NET foundational libraries.
1. *HelloRhinoCommonCommand.cs* is where the action is.  We'll make changes to this below...
1. *HelloRhinoCommonPlugin.cs* is where this template plugin derives from *Rhino.Plugins.Plugin* and returns a static Instance of itself.

### Make Changes

1. Open *HelloRhinoCommonCommand.cs* in Visual Studio's Source Editor (if it isn't already).
1. Notice that `HelloRhinoCommonCommand` inherits from `Command` ...

        public class HelloRhinoCommonCommand : Command
1. If you hover over `Command` you will notice this is actually `Rhino.Commands.Command`.
1. `HelloRhinoCommonCommand` also overrides one inherited property called `EnglishName` ...

        public override string EnglishName {
          get { return "HelloRhinoCommonCommand"; }
        }
1. All Rhino commands must have a `EnglishName` property.  This command name is not very accurate.  We know from running the boilerplate code that this command prompts the user to draw a line.  Let's rename the command to *HelloDrawLine*:

        public override string EnglishName {
          get { return "HelloDrawLine"; }
        }
1. Further down, notice that `HelloRhinoCommandCommand` overrides the `RunCommand` method:

        protected override Result RunCommand (Rhino.RhinoDoc doc, RunMode mode)
1. All Rhino commands must have a `RunCommand` method.  As you can see, this is where the action happens.  Let's create an intermediary line object that we can feed to the `AddLine` method.  Find the spot in `RunCommand` after the user has been prompted to select two points.  Type in...

        Rhino.Geometry.Line line1 = new Line (pt0, pt1);
1. Notice that - as you type - Visual Studio uses IntelliSense to create an auto-complete list of members to call.  Now, feed `line1` as an argument to the `doc.Objects.AddLine` method...

        doc.Objects.AddLine (line1);
1. Now that we have a line of our own, let's examine it...


### Debugging

1. Set a breakpoint on line[^1] 67 of *HelloRhinoCommonCommand.cs*.  You set breakpoints in Visual Studio by clicking in the gutter...
![Set a breakpoint](/images/your-first-plugin-windows-08.png)
1. *Build* and *Run*.  Because you have changed the name of the command, you will need to *"install"* the plugin again.  Follow the steps 3-5 in the [Boilerplate Build](#boilerplate-build) section above.
1. Run *HelloDrawLine* in Rhino.  Create the two points...as soon as you do, you should hit your breakpoint and pause...
![Hit a breakpoint](/images/your-first-plugin-windows-09.png)
1. With Rhino paused, in *Visual Studio* switch to the *Autos* tab (if it not already there).  In the list, find the `line1` object we authored.  Click the dropdown *arrow* to expand the list of members on `line1`.  Our `line1` is a `Rhino.Geometry.Line` this class has a `Length` property...
![Autos panel](/images/your-first-plugin-windows-10.png)
1. *Continue* in Rhino by pressing the *Continue* button in the upper menu of *Visual Studio* (or press <kbd>F5</kbd>)...
![Continue Executing](/images/your-first-plugin-windows-11.png)
1. Control is passed back to *Rhino* and your command finishes.  *Exit* Rhino or *Stop* the debugging session.
1. *Remove* the breakpoint you created above by clicking on it in the gutter.
1. Now, let's use the `Length` value to report something to the user.  Near the very end of `RunCommand`, add the following line...

```cs
RhinoApp.WriteLine ("The distance between the two points is {0}.", line1.Length);
```

1. *Save*, *Build*, and *Run*.  Run `HelloDrawLine` in Rhino yet again (create the two points...).  Rhino now reports the length of the line you created.  However, this is not very clean.
1. *Exit* Rhino to *Stop* the debugging session once more.
1. Let's add a unit system and be explicit about what we're reporting...

```cs
RhinoApp.WriteLine ("The distance between the two points is {0} {1}.", line1.Length, doc.ModelUnitSystem.ToString().ToLower());
```

1. *Save*, *Build*, and *Run* again.  Now we're reporting the length of the line we created with the document's unit system (`doc.ModelUnitSystem`) with the proper case (`ToLower()`).  Much better.

**DONE!**

Well, we could go on and on - `line1` was never necessary, we could have just used `pt0.DistanceTo(pt1).ToString()`, etc. - but that is beside the point:

*Congratulations!*  You have just built your first RhinoCommon plugin for Rhino for Windows.  *Now what?*

## Next Steps

You're using RhinoCommon, so this plugin will actually run on both platforms.  Check out the [Your First Plugin (Cross Platform)](/guides/rhinocommon/your-first-plugin-crossplatform) guide.
