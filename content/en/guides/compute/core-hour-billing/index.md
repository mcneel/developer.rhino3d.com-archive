## About Core-Hour Billing

When Rhino is logged in to a service account and is running on a Windows Server-based operating system, you will be billed **$0.10 per core per hour** that Rhino is running (pro-rated per minute).

***Example 1:** Rhino running on a 32-core server for one hour:*

  * 1 computer * 32-cores * 1 hour * $0.10/core-hour = $3.20

***Example 2:** Rhino running on 200 4-core servers for 6 minutes:*

  * 200 computers * 4 cores * 0.1 hour * $0.10/core-hour = $8.00

***Example 3:** 1 Rhino instance running on a 2-core server 8 hours a day for 30 days:*
  * 1 computer * 2 cores * 8 hours/day * 30 days/month * $0.10/core-hour = $48/month

***Example 4:** 10 Rhino instances running on a 2-core server 8 hours a day for 30 days:*
  * 1 computer * 2 cores * 8 hours/day * 30 days/month * $0.10/core-hour = $48/month
  * (Notice that the number of instances of Rhino does not affect your bill)

**Billing is based on uptime**, not on usage - we donâ€™t track the activity of each core, just that you have one running with Rhino. You can scale your workloads up and down to optimize performance and cost to you.

**Multiple instances are allowed** - you may run as many instances of Rhino on the same machine as you want, and the cost will be the same as running one instance.

## Setting Up Core-Hour Billing

Core-hour billing is required when running Rhino on a Windows Server-based operating system.

1. Go to the [Licenses Portal](https://www.rhino3d.com/licenses?_forceEmpty=true) (login to your Rhino account if prompted).
2. Click _Create New Team_ and create a team to use for your compute project.
3. Click _Action_ -> _Manage Core-Hour Billing_.
4. Check the checkbox next to Rhino 6 and Rhino 7 and the checkbox signaling you agree to pay.
5. Click _Save_, and enter payment information when prompted for your new team.

## Using Core-Hour Billing

{{< call-out "note" "Note" >}}
If you're following the <a href="../deploy" class="alert-link">"Deployment" guide</a>, you can <strong>skip step 3.</strong> and simply leave the page open for now. We'll use the token later when running the boostrap script which will take care of setting up the environment variable.
{{< /call-out >}}

1. Go to the [Licenses Portal](https://www.rhino3d.com/licenses?_forceEmpty=true) and select the team that you just set up with Core-hour billing.
2. Click _Action_ -> _Get Auth Token_ to get a token.
3. Create a new environment variable with the name `RHINO_TOKEN` and use the token as the value. Since the token is too long for Windows' Environment Variables dialog, it's easiest to do this via a PowerShell command.

    ```ps
    [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('RHINO_TOKEN', 'your token here', 'Machine')
    ```

From now on, when you start Rhino on this machine it will use your core-hour billing team.

{{< call-out "warning" "Warning" >}}
<strong>Warning!</strong> This token allows anyone with it to charge your team at will. Do <strong>NOT</strong> share this token with anyone.

## Single-Computer licensing Not Supported

When running on Windows Server, it is not possible to enter a license key to run as a single-computer license, as Rhino requires a license per core.
